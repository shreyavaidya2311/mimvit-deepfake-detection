## MIM-ViT: Deepfake Detection using Masked Image Modelling and Vision Transformer

### Introduction
<div align="justify">
The term “deepfake” is derived from the words “deep learning” and “fake”. Deepfakes are synthetic media that use deep learning to manipulate or replace the original content of an image, audio, or video file to create a new version that appears to be authentic. The number of deepfake videos has been multiplying rapidly in the past 5 years. The alarming rate of growth of deepfakes is a major cause of concern. Deepfake detection is important for several reasons:

- *Preventing Spread of Misinformation*

- *Protecting Personal Privacy*

- *Ensuring Digital Trust*

<div align="justify">
This work proposes a deep learning based approach to the above-stated problem statement which addresses three major research gaps, Multi-face Deepfake Detection, Face Quality Detection and Convergence with less data. The solution consists of two sub-models working in parallel, namely the Multiscale Vision Transformer and the Masked Autoencoder, ConvNeXt. A novel facial quality detection algorithm is developed, which helps improve the data quality by overcoming the challenge of misrepresented facial data.

### Applications - VStream

<div align="justify">
VStream is a video streaming application designed to provide users with an authentic and secure experience by ensuring that only real videos are uploaded and displayed on the platform. The application allows users to upload and watch videos, with a focus on ensuring the authenticity of the content. VStream utilizes the proposed model MIM-ViT to detect deepfake videos and prevents them from being shared.
